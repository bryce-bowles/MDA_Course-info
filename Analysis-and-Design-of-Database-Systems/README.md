## Projects Completed: Database Management (SQL/ PostgreSQL)
Automated Systems DBMS: Completed and proposed an Automated Systems Database to Manager - also created a MS Power BI Version. Centralized Relational SQL Database to help produce the appropriate roles for a position, creating consistency throughout departments and job titles (with the exception of optional roles for additional access) and reduce the number of access roles that are kept when changing positions. The DBMS unifies and consolidates system access to improve data security.
