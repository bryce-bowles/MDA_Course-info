Course Topics: Introduction to Analytics, Descriptive Analytics (Data Preparation for Analytics, Data Exploration and Visualization, Cluster Analysis and Principal Component Analysis); Predictive Analytics (Introduction to Classification, Empirical Evaluation of Classification, Choosing the Best Classification, Beyond Linear Regression); and Prescriptive Analytics (Using Machine Learning Predictions as Inputs to Optimization Models) 


## Projects Completed: 
Business Data Analytics (Machine Learning, Classification Trees, Regression, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, etc.)

* :star: [Alchemy Broker Analysis Project](https://github.com/bryce-bowles/alchemy-broker-modeling.git):  Performed segmentation analysis and predictive modeling on insurance broker performance to conclude a random forest model (highest AUC of 73%) predicted whether 2020 Gross Written Premium will increase or decrease from 2019 with a misclassification rate of 35%. Four classification models (classification trees, logistic regression, random forests, and support vector machines) were built, evaluated, and then tuned for prescriptive measures to analyze broker performance. Explored, visualized, and described five groups of brokers using principal component analysis.
* :star: :star: [Lending Club Data Analytics  in R](https://github.com/bryce-bowles/lending-club.git): Topics include the analytics work
flow, data preparation, visualization, cluster analysis, predictive modeling, and learning-enabled optimization. The Lending Club data is a mix of numeric, character, factor, and date data.
