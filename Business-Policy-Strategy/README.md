Strategic aspects of management. (MBA capstone course)

Strategic Theory: The concepts and tools that are used in Strategic Thinking
Strategic Management: The process whereby the firm chooses its business, establishes and sustains a strong competitive position in its industry, and enhances long-term performance. 
Strategic Thinking: The use of creative problem-solving techniques to develop innovative solutions required for long-term performance 
Strategy Execution: How managers convert strategic goals into plans and then action.

The objective of strategic management is to make strategic decisions that lead to above-average returns and long-term performance.  Superior performance is about meeting stakeholder’s needs. One important measure is profitability (i.e., maximizing shareholder value).  The firm enhances long-term performance choosing a good business in which it has the resources and competencies to compete, and by establishing a competitive advantage relative to competitors that is sustainable over time.  Competitive advantage is driven by executives’ effective analysis of the firm’s external environment and the development of internal resources and capabilities that lead to a sustainable competitive advantage.  The objective of this course is help students to develop better insight into how effective strategy making leads to superior performance, to understand the basic concepts, tools, and models of strategic analysis, and to develop practice in formulating and implementing effective strategy. 

Business Policy & Strategy differs from others in that it takes the broad perspective of the general manager rather than the narrower perspective of the functional manager. A general manager must integrate the functional activities of the business into a coherent whole. Thus, the course cuts across the entire spectrum of business and management activities.  The course focuses on the total enterprise – the brand’s industry and competitive environment, its long-term direction and strategy, its resources and competitive capabilities, and its prospects for long-term success. Throughout the course, the spotlight is trained on the issue of running the business enterprise:  “What must managers do, and do well, to make a company a winner in the game of business?”  The answer that emerges, as well as the theme of the course, is that good strategy making and good strategy execution are the key ingredients of a company’s success and the most reliable signs of good management.

### Group Projects: 
Project Teams are central to the course design. In management situations, we start off with our own perspectives and understanding of the situation. We then confer with our associates – above, peer and subordinate – to understand their views and convey ours, learning from each other. The conclusions reached and/or decisions made may be a consensus, or our or someone else to make. Whatever the case, group involvement is a key part of the management process.
