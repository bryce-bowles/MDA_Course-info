Teaches methods of monetizing or otherwise valuing intangible data practice improvement opportunities in the context of organizational strategy as part of a semester long participation with regional organizations. (Department of Social Services DSS) Students use data-centric business case development to gain practical experience (all the fun of work experience without the pay). Student teams will work closely with organizational leadership to articulate a specific business case. Teams will evaluate data-centric means of improving operational effectiveness and/or innovation opportunities and recommend specific approaches and estimated benefits.


Outcomes: To provide advanced knowledge, understanding, and practice of various systems and business (re)engineering techniques as they should be encountered in business contexts. Approximately one half of class is devoted to lecture material and one-half to the semester project(s). This course typically involves the development of working information solutions to real-life organizational problems. These problems are addressed using group and individual assignments. The solutions to these challenges are not typically known at the beginning of the semester.

Objectives	To provide the opportunity to gain:
1)	Demonstrate they have a grasp of data reengineering concepts and techniques by specifically articulating the precise challenge;
2)	Experience the thrill of an evolving project; and
3)	Illustrate how to select and apply appropriate tools and techniques.
