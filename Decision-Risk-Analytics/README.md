SCMA 691 Special Topic: Decision and Risk Analytics

Professor: Dr. Jason R. W. Merrick, jrmerric@vcu.edu, Phone: (804) 828 7483

Although difficult decisions are a common fact of life and business, understanding how to rigorously analyze decisions is not so common. Decision analytics is a set of concepts and tools that produce clarity about the best choice in an uncertain and dynamic environment. Decision analytics is most effective in environments with high analytical and organizational complexity.

Focusing on each element of a rational decision and involving the right stakeholders make it possible to create significant value, mitigate risk, and avoid mistakes. Structure complex decisions using diagrams and models that decompose the alternatives, uncertainties, and objectives and reveal the best strategy. Discussed the probabilistic and statistical underpinnings of good decision-making and the psychology of bad decision-making.

Analytics Process:
Information Systems > Descriptive Analytics > Predictive Analytics > Decision/Prescriptive Analytics

Decision Analytics is the final step in the analytics process. You must collect your data (information systems), understand your data (descriptive analytics), make predictions about the outcomes of your decisions (predictive analytics), and then make a rigorous and high-quality decision (decision analytics). Dr. Merrick has used decision analytics throughout his research in oil spill risk management, counterterrorism, and supply chain management. He also served as president of the Decision Analysis Society.
