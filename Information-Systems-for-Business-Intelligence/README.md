Good business decision making hinges on a few key ingredients – knowing how to structure and frame up a business problem, using appropriate analytic tools and making effective presentations and pitches. This course will refine your ability to clearly articulate and tackle diverse business problems ranging from the marketing, pricing, sourcing, credit risk, targeting and complex simulations. With each business case you will be introduced to a new business tool. Learn how to use it and more importantly when to use it.

One of the most commonly seen pitfalls in the analytic world is sound technical analysis hamstrung by meandering, incoherent or overly complicated story telling. If the presentation is not effective, everything else accomplished prior to that becomes diluted or even moot.  A consistent emphasis across all 4 project modules (see schedule below) will be the ability to convey your insights and sell your recommendations in an effective manner. The rest of the students and the professors will roleplay as ‘management’ in class – asking for clarifications and probing deeper.
