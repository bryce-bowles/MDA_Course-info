### Course Objectives: 
“Create constancy of purpose toward improvement of product and service, with the aim to becoming competitive, stay in business, and provide jobs.”
Dr. W. Edward Deming’s First Principle of Management

The consumer of a product or service experiences quality as a characteristic of the product or service; however, quality is not an attribute of the product or service itself, but a result of the system that produces it. An organization with a sustained quality cultural will produce quality products and services, delighted customers, fulfilled employees, pleased investors, and be positioned to respond to changing conditions. An organization without such a culture may do well enough during good times but be marginal during tough times, and likely to fail completely during extended bad times. We’ve seen too many examples of this; Kodak, Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, Bethlehem and US Steel, Enron, Borders Books, Sears and too many more.

We’ve seen other organizations faced with equally difficult environments survive and prosper; Ford Motors, Harley Davison, Xerox, Boeing, Caterpillar, Motorola, IBM to name a few. What’s the difference?

The companies that prevailed made difficult wrenching changes in their organizational cultural. It wasn’t quick; it wasn’t easy. It started at the very top and flowed throughout the organization. No employee or supplier was untouched. Using Crosby’s analogy, the existing fabric of the culture was rent and a new fabric created.

Many of the companies in the list of failed organization also invested heavily in quality and continuous improvement programs. However, much of the resulting changes were superficial, layered on top of the old culture.  When push came to shove management retrenched into comfortable behaviors that had served them well in the past but were ill-suited for their current situation. They failed to adopt the new philosophy. (Deming’s second principle: Adopt the new philosophy.)

We will elucidate both the new philosophy of quality management and the tools that support it. Quality programs are sometimes thought of as a bag of statistical tools. However tools without the philosophy is like building a house with the saws, hammers, and other tools but no blueprint or plan. There is likely to be a lot of activity, but unlikely to produce anything of use. Similarly a philosophy without supporting tools is just that - a philosophy. Philosophy alone is unlikely to produce either activity or results.

## Projects Completed
* [Time Series Apple Watch Workout Analysis](https://github.com/bryce-bowles/TS-Apple_Watch_Data) Time series health workout data was extracted from my Apple watch to analyze workout variables. A Scope, descriptive statistics, pivot tables, C-Chart and scatter plots were created to check workouts outside of control. Tableau work was used to display correlations.
