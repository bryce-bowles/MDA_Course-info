Program goal ([Graduate Bulletin link](http://bulletin.vcu.edu/graduate/school-business/supply-chain-management/decision-analytics-mda/#text)):

The Master of Decision Analytics provides students with knowledge of the statistical, mathematical and scientific skills and experience necessary to utilize advanced methods of data analysis for business decision-making.
Student learning goals
Students will be able to examine a situation/problem to determine a relevant data-driven analysis to provide valuable information for decision makers and apply advanced analytical and quantitative skills to the decision problems of businesses, organizations and society. Students will be able to communicate analysis information and recommended decisions in a clear, ethical and transparent manner.

1.	Database structures and query: Students will have an understanding of basic database structures, be able to query databases and organize data for analysis. 
2.	Quantitative skills: Students will be able to identify appropriate data analysis approaches to address real-world problems. They will be able to perform the analysis using commercial software. 
3.	Problem formulation: Students will have the knowledge, skills and practice to take nonquantitative and perhaps ill-formed problems and issues and determine ways objective analysis can bring organization and insight to them. They will be able to determine data requirements and query available databases. 
4.	Analytics applications: Students will experience various applications of analytics in real situations. 
5.	Technical communications and teamwork: Students will be able to communicate analytical analysis and results effectively to nonquantitative audiences, and will develop skills in organizing, interacting and analyzing real problems as members of a team.
