Text: Business Analytics: Data Analysis & Decision Making, 7th Edition - S. Christian Albright and Wayne L. Winston (Cengage Unlimited ISBN: 9780357692677)

Statistical analysis and modeling for decision analytics. Topics covered have an applied focus and may include logistic regression, bootstrap estimation, permutation tests, categorical data analysis, model selection, sparse methods and Bayesian methods. Statistical analysis of data will be conducted using business-oriented computational software.

Learning Objectives, Each student should be able to:
•	Visualize and explore data
•	Compare groups in a population
•	Build complex regression models and use them to make predictions
•	Perform clustering and classification analysis

Software: Tableau, Excel and XLSTAT, R and RStudio

### Topics: 
Data Visualization in Tableau, Confidence Intervals, Hypothesis Testing, XLSTAT and R, One-way Analysis of Variance, Two-way Analysis of Variance, Designed Experiments, scatter plots and correlations simple linear regression, Introduction to multiple regression, Dummy variables, Interaction Terms, Inference for multiple regression, Testing for and fixing problems, multicollinearity, outliers, heteroscedasticity, non-normality, Stepwise regression, Prediction, Cross-validation, Sparse Methods, Lasso regression, Correlated predictors, Ridge regression, Classification Methods, Logistic regression, Neural networks, Classification trees, Clustering, K-means clustering, Hierarchical clustering, Normal mixtures, Bootstrap methods, Forecasting, Diagnostic tools, Testing for randomness, Linear and exponential trends, Dummy seasonality variables, Moving averages and decomposition, Forecasting, Exponential smoothing, ARIMA models, Time Series Forecasting, Other Text used: [Forecasting: Principles and Practice, 3rd edition, Rob J Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos, OTexts, 2019](https://otexts.com/fpp3/)

## Projects Completed: 
* [Whiskey Analysis](https://github.com/bryce-bowles/whiskey-prediction.git): Logistic regression model to predict the best and worst whiskeys using Confusion Matrix with training and validation samples. Correlation matrix, goodness of fit statistics, Hosmer-Lemeshow test, chi-squared, confusion matrix, Scatter plots, box plots etc.
