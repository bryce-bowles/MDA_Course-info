### Course Overview: 
"I look to the future because that's where I'm going to spend the rest of my life."
George Burns, American actor, comedian

"Business more than any other occupation is a continual dealing with the future; it is a continual calculation, an instinctive exercise in foresight."
Henry R. Luce, Editor-publisher, founder of TIME

Every human activity beyond basic survival requires some vision of the future. That’s where all our successes, failures, joys and disappointments will be.  This is doubly true in business. Whether it’s a decision to increase or decrease inventory, spend money on marketing a product or service, hire additional employees or train current ones, invest in new product research or buy back your own stock, the bases of the decision is what management believes about the future. 

No one can know the future completely, but as Kenneth Boulding states, “The future is bound to surprise us, but we don't have to be dumbfounded.” This course will give the tools and understanding you need to make the best business decisions possible given the current state of knowledge.

The most accurate forecast in the world is of no value if management does not accept and act on it. Acceptance of forecasts largely depends upon management’s understanding of the methods involved and appreciation of associated issues and caveats. This course will develop communication, presentation, and consulting skills which will help students explain, in non-technical terms, forecasts to management.

### Forecasting:
The emphasis will be on developing practical approaches to forecasting for business. We will develop forecasting tools with Microsoft Excel. Although less automated than available commercial forecasting systems it allows students to understand the basic principles underlying their forecasts. If students later use a dedicated forecasting program they will understand the core assumptions and appreciate the limitations of the forecast. 
We will cover time series forecasting, new product forecasting, judgmental forecasts, Bayes forecasting and overview several popular forecasting software systems. We will also discuss organizational concerns when implementing a forecasting system in a real organization.

## Projects Completed
* :star: [Richmond Bank Total Core Deposit Forecasts](https://github.com/bryce-bowles/tsf-richmond-bank.git) Using MS Excel and R, accurately forecasted total core deposit data from a Richmond Bank. The Holt’s Linear Exponential Smoothing had the overall lowest “Quick and Dirty” MAPE (1.2%), the lowest overall Maximum MAPE (3.49%), and consistently more accurate projections for each of the forecast horizons. Overall, the Unaided, Holts Linear Exponential Smoothing, and both regressions overestimated while the Naïve, 12 Month (M) Center Moving Average (CMA), 3M Moving Average (MA), 6M MA, Damped Trend Exponential Smoothing, and Simple Exponential Smoothing underestimated. 
* [Richmond Casino Proposal Analysis](https://github.com/bryce-bowles/richmond-casino-analysis.git) Research analysis completed on the proposal of a Richmond, VA Casino presentation including history/background, economic/revenue impact, frustrations, process etc. 
* [New Product Forecasting](https://github.com/bryce-bowles/new-product-forecasting-concepts.git) New product forecasting concepts (such as Delphi method, Assumptions Based, ATAR model, and Sensitivity Analysis) used to forecast and present an innovative smart sticky note printer.
* [Forecasting with R](https://github.com/bryce-bowles/forecasting_with_R.git) Forecasting described from the perspective of using R and R studio software. 
* [KJ Manufacturing Company Case Scenario](https://github.com/bryce-bowles/KJ-manufacturing-TSF.git)
    1.	Discussed the forecasting process at KJ Manufacturing, any relevant factors about the company and industry that are pertinent to the new forecast and Ken’s forecast. 
    2.	Forecasted monthly revenues for KJ Manufacturing for the coming year. Used a variety of methods and graphically displayed them. Explained and supported the new forecasting approach as well as the choice of models and the rational for parameters selected. 
    3.	Prepared a report to owner explaining/supporting the forecast.
